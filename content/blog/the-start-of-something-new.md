This is going to be the start of my blog, where I will be covering my personal endeavors, tech, and whatever I would
like to write about.

This has been something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time, but I haven’t had the “time” to do it… More like, I
haven’t found the inspiration to start, the same goes for my portfolio. Been ages since I added a little banner in my
portfolio warning visitors that the content of my
portfolio is out of date.

So baby steps, and here I go with my first post of many (I hope).

Stay tuned!
