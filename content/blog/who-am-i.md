# Prelude

First of all, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Jose Chirivella, and I am a software engineer. I have been
working in the tech industry for over 10 years, and I have a passion for writing code and building products.

I have worked in various companies, from small startups to large corporations, and I have learned a lot from each of
them. I have experience in web development, mobile development, and cloud computing, and I am always looking to learn
new technologies and improve my skills.

I decided to start this blog to share my personal endeavors, tech, and whatever I would like to write about. I hope you
enjoy reading my posts, and feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions or feedback.

Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope to see you again soon!

## About Me

Male, 29 years old, married, no kids, 2 dogs that count as kids, 2 siblings. Born in Venezuela, moved to the US in 2014
via the
Green Card Lottery, yeah... I was one of the lucky ones who got selected from millions of people around the world, only
300 thousand get selected, and only 50 thousand get an actual green card after going through a really tough background
checks, medical tests and a one time only interview at the US Embassy to proof the value you bring to the US.

## Life before the US

Both parents worked for the public sector, dad was an Engineer and mom is a Doctor. Dad used to work for one of the
subsidiaries of the main (and only) oil company in Venezuela called PDVSA, and he was laid off when Chavez took over the
presidency.
He couldn't find a job for the longest time due to his age (40) where companies would rather hire younger people without
thinking about pension.
Mom took over as the main provider, even thought she was a Doctor, working for the public sector in Venezuela, doesn't
mean much.
Still, my parents did a lot of sacrifices to give us a good education, and I am forever grateful for that.
I went to a private school, and I was able to learn English from a young age, which helped me a lot when I moved to the
US.
Brother is a Computer Engineer and sister is a Chemical Engineer. I was the only one who didn't graduate from College
*spoiler alert*, but I'll get on that later.

Elementary did ok, High School did terrible, graduated with a low GPA, too lazy to study, did great in Sports (soccer,
tennis and golf)

In Venezuela, and some colleges in the US, if the parent is a Professor at the University, the kids get a one pass entry
without any test or scores to public school which it was one of the best in the nation. I wanted to follow my Mom steps
and become a Doctor, but I didn't have the discipline of studying and Medical school required a lot, but what really
threw me off was the current health system in Venezuela, parents suffering, no supplies, no medicine, no equipment, no
nothing, and I didn't want to be part of that. So, I went with my third option, which was Computer Engineering. Second
option was being a Pilot but it would mean spending a lot of time travelling and I had a girlfriend at the time which I
eventually married her.

## College

Went to private college, 20 min away from home, curriculum was ok, at the fifth semester it split between network
engineering, software engineering, and hardware engineering. My first programming class, I remember looking at a
terminal, and it was like... Nope. Not for me.
Funny how things change, right?

## The first year as an immigrant in the US

May 2014, I arrived in the US, I was 19 years old, left my high school sweetheart behind, I was in my third/fourth
semester of College. Parents sold everything, left their jobs, moved to another country at 60 years old. I was the
mistake btw, my Mom had me when she was 43 ðŸ˜³

I had a couple of options, go back to college full time, work part-time, or work full time and go to college part-time.
I was going to choose, working part-time and seeing some classes here and there but I encountered an option I didn't
take into consideration because I didn't know their existence to be honest and that was Code Schools.
I first arrived to Charlotte, North Carolina where we had a cousin that was studying at Duke and just launched her own
company. She was the one that told me about Code Schools, and I was like... What is that? She explained to me that it
was and the outcome of it.
At the time, it was 10k for 3 months, intensive, and you would learn how to code and get a job at the end of it. I was
intrigued, I quickly set up a meeting with the Campus director, **Hey Jessica!**, to know more about this coding school
called **The Iron Yard**. They offered multiple courses but the one I was interested was Front-end Engineering.

All this happened in the first two weeks of me arriving to the US, already to a good start. I applied to The Iron Yard
meanwhile we were driving to our final destination which it was Miami, Florida. We had relatives there and they were
really helpful to settle in. While I waited to hear back from The Iron Yard, I started working as an Assistant for a VC
since
he worked closely with all matters related to Venezuela, he wanted somebody who could understand how everything worked
with our troublesome country.

Around August, I heard back from TIY, I was accepted, and I had to start in September. I was excited and eager to start,
bough my first Mac ever, a Macbook Pro 13" with 8gb of RAM and a Intel Processor.
I was STOKED! My cousin, the CEO, offered me board for the first two weeks and she got me a private room in a house with
her best friend.

Everything was going to plan except that chaos started to happen and reality was settling in. I received a call a few
days before starting the course that the Teacher that was going to teach us, got a job offer in another place and they
wanted me to move to South Carolina alone, or stay in Durham but take the Ruby on Rails Engineering course... I knew
nothing about backend, nightmares about the terminal, and databases. But, I didn't want to move in to a strange city in
another state without emotional support.

I decided to stay in Durham and take the Ruby on Rails Engineering course. I was the youngest in the class, 2nd youngest
to possible graduate. Everyone had a different background, different expectations and different goals.
