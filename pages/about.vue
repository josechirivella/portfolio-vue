      Originally, from Venezuela. Was studying Computer Engineering when my
      family had the chance to migrate to the US in 2014. Quickly decided that I
      wasn't going to spent my parents retirement, instead, worked really hard
      to pay myself a Coding School called The Iron Yard in 2014. After
      graduation, my career launched working for a couple of startups like
      Windsor Circle, MATI Energy, and others... Also, worked for a top 500
      company called Cisco Systems üòÆ‚Äçüí®

      Laravel and NodeJS
