    <p class="mb-4">I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, mostly front-end but I have joined the dark side in the past.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">Originally, from Venezuela. Was studying Computer Engineering when my family had the change to migrate to the US in 2014. Quickly decided that I wasn't going to spent my parents retirement,
      instead, worked really hard to pay myself a Coding School called The Iron Yard in 2015. After that, my career launched working for a couple of startups like Windsor Circle, MATI Energy, and others...
      Also, worked for a top 500 company called Cisco Systems 😮‍💨.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">I have become an expert in Vue and Angular. This blog was written in Nuxt. I have used Rails in the past and Laravel for my previous experience.</p>
